# Overview
Welcome to the repository containing a snippet of a research project done during summer 2023 by Gabrielle Salamanca. Lead by Professor Tao He, research was conducted on T-Cell Receptor (TCR) Reportoire Data. This research looks particularly at the vj genes of the TCRs, which was taken amino acids that was translated from nucleotides.

The main motivation of this research was to see if we can use the TCR/BCR (B-Cell Receptor) profile to predict the cancer type, if we can find some features of the TCR/BCR profile that can distinguish between different cancer types. However, with this work, we're using a dataset that looks at covid and healthy patients, where our Y is the disease stage (active, recovered, healthy). 

We have also added in two datasets concerning lung patients and will be applying the same techniques used in the covid/healthy datasets.
