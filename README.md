# Overview
Welcome to the repository containing a snippet of a research project done during summer 2023 by Gabrielle Salamanca. Lead by Professor Tao He, the research was conducted on T-Cell Receptor (TCR) Reportoire Data. This research looks particularly at the vj genes of the TCRs, which was taken amino acids that was translated from nucleotides.  

![TCR](https://github.com/asphodelian/TCR-Project/assets/125179245/a2740f4d-489a-4fd8-8634-e3a3a7ec136c)

The main motivation of this research was to see if we can use the TCR/BCR (B-Cell Receptor) profile to predict the cancer type, if we can find some features of the TCR/BCR profile that can distinguish between different cancer types. However, with this work, we're using a dataset that looks at covid and healthy patients, where our Y is the disease stage (active, recovered, healthy). 

We have also added in two datasets concerning lung patients and will be applying the same techniques used in the covid/healthy datasets. Unfortunately, time ran out explore these datasets. Look to this [repo](https://github.com/asphodelian/Lung-Cancer) on its continuation!

## Fall 2025 Update
This project has been picked up again in Fall 2025, Gabrielle's last semester of her Statistical Data Science Master's program. This is for the Culminating Experience, Math 895: Project and Exam. A new folder will be made within existing folders to hold the new work and will have 2025 within the name.

The goal of this project is to try to create a model to predict the data, first with a binary Y, and if possible, with a multiple classes Y.
